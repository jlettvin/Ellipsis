___Ordinary text can appear anywhere.
`  `No special markup or markdown is necessary to have ordinary text appear.
`  `A paragraph is construed as
any block of text not separated by an empty line.
`  `An empty line is used to indicate the beginning of a new paragraph.

___Text is indented or given extra space by using
three underscores in a row ___ at the beginning of a line.
`  `This enables authors to use traditional indenting of paragraphs.
It can also be achieved with backticks enclosing three spaces.
`  `Backticks enclosing two spaces separates sentences by more than one space.


___Ordinary HTML wraps text around
images and other block material aligned to either side.
`  `To avoid this, a string of four 'v's (letters v) in a row
forces text to continue underneath the block.
`  `To stop the current line and continue on the next,
a string of three 'v's becomes a simple line break.

==== Equations

`   `Equations can be referenced both backwards and forwards.
`  `For instance,
    `equation.Pythagoras`
has not been defined yet but will be defined below.
`  `Equations make use of `TeX` notation.
    `equation.Pythagoras|Pythagorean theorem|a^2 = b^2 + c^2`
`  `Now that it has been defined, we can reference it again here with
    `equation.Pythagoras`.
    `equation.quadratic|the quadratic formula|-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a`
`   `Here we show the quadratic `equation.quadratic` to illustrate that
numbering extends over multiple equations.

`equation?This is a bookmark for a future equation.`
`equation?`

==== Plots

Here, we just backtick gnuplot to see defaults and source location.
`gnuplot`

Here, we backtick with an id to forward reference..
`gnuplot.cos`

Here, we backtick a future plot.
`gnuplot?This is a bookmark for a future plot.  This note describes it.`

Here, we ask for the gnuplot service documentation.
`gnuplot?`

Here, we backtick define a gnuplot.
`gnuplot.cos|cos(x) and sin(x)|{width="256" height="256"}plot cos(x) lw 3,sin(x) lw 3`
