`figure.Airy|Airy pattern|RGB.Airy.small.png`
___Whither and whence visual photons
needs must uncertain be
yet by lawful pattern ruled.
Photons are produced, scattered, reflected, refracted, diffracted and,
finally, incident and aborbed by the retina in "bleaching" events.
Daylight photons result from solar blackbody emissions
with notches due to atmospheric absorption.
Surviving photons are scattered by the atmosphere,
reflect off objects, refract through the cornea, diffract through the pupil,
and are absorbed by various species of photoreceptors.
Each of these processes contribute to spectral transforms.

___In the study of perception, there appear to be laws governing invariance.
Contrast invariance and color invariance are two popular study subjects.
It is not possible to discuss these invariants without discussing the
quantitative absorption of photons by the retina from a typical scene.
Most modern synthesis of images depends on the use of RGB emission
usually produced by LEDs and for purposes of improving robotic vision.
Notwithstanding the LMS retinal cone species having similar spectral peaks,
the images produced for use with an achromatic lens
and with an Airy disk smaller than a pixel for a digital camera
are not suitable for analyzing images produced by the chromatic natural lens
and Airy disk always larger than the human equivalent of pixel.
The subject of this paper is the production ane encoding of synthetic images
suitable for analysis of human visual invariants.

___Two transforms dominate the formation of images on the retina;
corneal refraction and pupillary diffraction.
Both have &lambda; (wavelength) dependence.
Corneal refraction is modelled by a \(1/\lambda\) proportional affine transform
where short wavelengths are expanded more than long wavelengths.
Pupillary diffraction is modelled by convolution with a
\(\lambda\) proportional Airy kernel;
where the kernel is
smaller for short wavelengths and larger for long wavelengths.
In other words, for a white object on a black background you will oberve
a blue tinge ringing the object as seen through a magnifying glass and
a red tinge ringing it as seen in the Airy disk from a pinhole.

___Both of these transforms apply to mathematical models of images
formed from photons counting in the millions or billions.
The affine transform from refraction is modelled simply enough.
Analysis of diffraction and synthesis of suitable diffraction images
from very low to very high photon counts will be
the primary focus of this paper.
Images produced and encoded using these methods
will enable further research into how retinal processing achieves invariance.

==== Diffraction and Low Photon Counts

___When a very large number of photons from a point source
pass through an aperture and then fall on a surface
they accumulate in a diffraction pattern called an Airy pattern `figure.Airy`.
This intensity pattern is the square of
the photon wave function `equation.wave`.
Photon densities are properly synthesized by summing the wave equations
for all points over all wavelengths and squaring the result.
`comment.ignore|ignore|
Through the principle of superposition,
Photons do not interact.
As individual photons from a point source accumulate into an image
they tend to accumulate as an Airy pattern.
The accumulation has the character of a wave.
`

___This pattern of intensity is ruled by `equation.Airy`.
This formula represents the idealized continuous distribution
from which deviation is unmeasurable at high photon counts.
Discrete photons do not form a continuous set.
Nor do sensors arranged along a grid in a focal plane in an eye or camera.
The zoomed "pixels" in `figure.Airy` illustrate this grid
for billions of RGB source photons seen for a centrally located point source.

___Close examination reveals that different wavelengths
contribute differentially to the pattern at different radii.
Photographic and visual colors are typically thought to operate using RGB.
The names R (red), G (green), and B (blue), as wavelengths,
are typically thought to be related to color perception.
In fact, color perception is independent of wavelength
`reference.LettvinColorsOfThings`.
The scientific labelling for RGB in retinal photoreceptor absorption
is LMS for Long, Medium, and Short.
However, since photography and displays use RGB,
they will be used interchangeably.

___The retinal image of two white RGB point sources
incident on the human retina after traversing a 1mm pupil
appears as an inchoate blur incapable of being resolved
by Rayleigh criterion, Sparrow limit, or even
traditional use of Fourier transform coupled with Nyquist sampling.

___The wavelength dependence in `figure.2onretina`
is even more apparent than for `figure.Airy`.
This is the character of image for narrow band RGB illumination.
This paper will explore the problem of forming
retinal equivalent incident photons using broadband illumination
and methods for producing suitable sensed images for
analyzing how the sensory data for vision is presented.
Even in `figure.2onretina`, enough photons are present
to give the image a seemingly continuous character.

___When photon flux is low, the Airy pattern becomes
more difficult to discern as can be seen in the models
of accumulations of single monochromatic photon events
in `figure.1photon` to `figure.3000photon`.

___As can be seen, even at 3000 photons from a point source
the Airy pattern is yet to assume the continuous character
achieved at much higher photon fluxes experienced in daylight
or even low incandescent lighting.

___Vision still works fairly well at low light levels
so whatever explanation is made for vision
must account for the ability to convert patterns such as these
to good enough quality internal reconstructions of the scene.

___It is important to note that,
when point sources are eccentric from the center,
different wavelength photons refract and diffract
to different centers aligned radially from the center;
yet the perception of a polychromatic point is of a single point source.

{width="256" height="256"}Incandescent.png`
___Natural lighting is not divided into photons having
3 or 4 energy bands discussed in robotic vision literature.
Daylight spectra are considered continuous in that
no energies or wavelengths are forbidden.
Typically, ambient light is broad spectrum as in `figure.blackbody`.
Sunlight resembles the 6500K curve with atmospheric absorption.
An incandescent lightbulb peak temperature is 3695K which yields
a slope that appears to rise monotonically from the blue end to the red end.
The spectrum of `figure.incandescent` is
typical for a light bulb at 2800K.
When moving from sunlight into incandescent light
one does not perceive a change in colors.
The change of spectrum does not change the colors seen
but the size, shape, and spectral composition
have changed dramatically by the change in light source.

`def.I_0|Peak intensity|I<sub>0</sub>`
___The two spectra of `figure.blackbody` and `figure.incandescent`
were produced with `equation.blackbody`.
The theory of this curve is well explored.
Blackbody radiation may be specified with two parameters,
T (degrees Kelvin), and visual angle (or amplitude).
`equation.blackbody2|Blackbody equation in &lambda;|
I(\lambda,T) =
\frac{2 h c^3}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{exp{\left(\frac{h c}{\lambda k T}\right)}-1}
`
`equation.blackbody|Blackbody equation in &nu;|
I(\nu,T) =
\frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^2}\frac{1}{exp{\left(\frac{h\nu}{kT}\right)}-1}
where:
h=Planck constant
c=speed of light in a vacuum
k=Boltzmann constant
&nu;=photon frequency
T=body temperature in Kelvin
`
___Other spectra like `figure.receptor` and `figure.camera`
are generated using short lists of coefficient triples (a,b,c).
The curves in both of these figures took one or two triples each.
This equation is used for convenient curve-fitting.

{width="256" height="256"}Camera.png`
___The typical trichromat human has three cone photoreceptors L, M, and S.
A fourth, rod photoreceptor, is labelled X in `figure.receptor`.
As can be seen, all human photoreceptors
absorb photons having short wavelengths.
Absorption of photons at the longer end have sharp relative cutoffs
such that the S cone absorbs almost no photons at wavelengths above ~550nm.
The M cone cuts off at ~625nm, and L cone cuts off at ~710nm.
Note the curious increase of L and M cone absorption at shorter wavelengths.
All this indicates that the wavelengths in a scene are not
as sharply divided into color planes
as is assumed in standard image processing.

___A critical function of vision is to identify
readiness of a resource by its color.
Regardless of the ambient light, a ripe apple should look red.
In fact, it does when viewed under a blue sky, a green forest canopy,
a red sunset, or by sodium light having only
two yellow and one blue spectral line.
The redness of the apple does not depend on
the presence of long wavelength photons.
This is called color constancy and is what was described
for perception under `figure.blackbody` and `figure.incandescent`.

___The conditions under which this occurs are special.
An achromatic lens is required.


___The straight lines predicted by optics between this origin
identify the center of a probability distribution at the destination.
The relative probability of a photon of specific energy from a specific source
being absorbed within a specific tile in a grid of a tiled surface
is calculated by integrating the infinitesimal probabilities over the tile.

___There are four photoreceptor species in the typical trichromat human eye.
Variations in species presence and distribution are found in individuals.
These images are fictional characterizations of what is found in vivo.
The images are produced on a rectangular grid but, in vivo,
the grid is more similar to a hexagonal grid, but nowhere near reliably.
These distributions are largely consistent with published data:
such as the site:
^^^
http://www.cvrl.org/database/text/intros/introdens.htm
`table.photoreceptors|Photoreceptor Species|
L|photoreceptors (cones shown as red)|~566nm peak absorption
M|photoreceptors (cones shown as green)|~533nm peak absorption
I|photoreceptors (rods shown as cyan)|~498nm peak absorption
S|photoreceptors (cones shown as blue)|~433nm peak absorption
`

___L cones typically dominate in the macula but M cone dominance is not rare.
S cones do not appear within 100&micro;M of center and are far fewer in number.
Rods are not present in these figures
and only begin to populate the retina in the outer part of the macula
where they increase to 100% outside the macula.
`table.photoreceptors` represents the species in the typical trichromat human.
Note that the distribution has no reliable pattern and is effectively random.

___As is shown in `figure.mosaicL` to `figure.mosaicS`,
were the species to be treated as image planes,
the effective image for each plane would have lacunae.
This will be treated in a later paper focused on processing
based on these effective images and the shapes of neurons.
Here, it will be shown what information is present
when full-spectrum scenes cause absorption events in the retina.
