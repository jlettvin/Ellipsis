=== Full spectrum image file representation.

___Currently, there is no popular stored image format capable of
storing a full spectrum image of the sort needed for this analysis.
It is possible to specify a format for use in this paper.
The format for a given pixel may be given as a list of specifications.
Each specification has 1 bit to identify the coefficients as either
blackbody `figure.blackbody` `equation.blackbody`
or gaussian `equation.gaussian2` (a variation on `equation.gaussian`).
If identified as blackbody,
a pair of (I<sub>0</sub>,T) coefficients or (a,b) follows. 
If identified as gaussian, an (\(I_0,\lambda_{peak},RMSwidth\))
or (a,b,c) coefficient triple follows. 

`equation.gaussian2|Gaussian function in &lambda;|
I(\lambda) =
I_0~exp{\left(
-\frac{\left(\lambda-\lambda_{peak}
\right)^2}{2 RMSwidth^2}\right)}
`

___The spectrum of a pixel may be fully described as a list of components:
(B:((a1,b1),(a2,b2)...), G:((a3,b3,c3),(a4,b4,c4)...)).
Each coefficient is a floating point number limited to a small range.
Using the "half" float (16 bits), it is possible for
blackbody specifications to occupy 32 bits and gaussian to occupy 48 bits.
\(I_0\) Cannot be negative, so the sign bit of coefficient a
may be used to indicate whether it is a G (gaussian) or B (blackbody).
For shorthand, uppercase letters will indicate Blackbody coefficients
when the first coefficient is negative.
Here is a fanciful pixel spectrum: (A1,B1,a2,b2,c2,a3,b3,c3,A4,B4).
In most cases, only one or two components will be used.
In no case shown in this paper will blackbody and gaussian components be mixed.

`figure.LEDs|RGB LED Spectrum|
{width="256" height="256"}LEDs.png`
___An example is the white body spectrum `figure.whitebody`
where intensity variation over the entire visible spectrum is less than 1%.
This is expressable as the 96 bit or 12 byte (A1,B1,A2,B2,A3,B3) with values
^^^
(-1e-2,8.7e+3,-3.226e-2,5.6e+3,-1.732e+0,3e+3).
Note the negative values for A1, A2, and A3
indicating black body coefficients.

___Another example is the spectral composition of a white LED pixel
when using LEDs of types R:AlGaAs, G:AlGaInP, B:InGaN.
The b coefficient is given in nanometers.
`figure.LEDs`.
In this figure, each component is given by a single gaussian.

___Typically, images are laid out as either raster sequences of pixels
or as vector graphics.  Another alternative, used here,
is to give the coordinates of a pixel at which a spectrum is expressed.
With (x,y) expressed as 12 bits for each coordinate (24 bits)
a pixel is expressed as (x,y,a1,b1,c1,a2,b2,c2...).
3 bytes for coordinates and
6 bytes for each gaussian or 4 bytes for each blackbody component.
This pixel spectrum may be used for spectral calculations
such as multiplying the probabilities of capture by a photoreceptor
by the probabilities of photons arriving from a scene.
An S photoreceptor `figure.receptor` takes 9 bytes.
An M and L photoreceptor each take 15 bytes
for complete spectral representation.
For instance with positive a1, and a2 for gaussian coefficients:
`bulleted.spectra|Spectra for human cones|
L cone spectrum (x1,y1,I0,564,0.58e-7,0.25*I_0,400,0.58e-7)
M cone spectrum (x2,y2,I0,534,0.58e-7,0.25*I_0,400,0.58e-7)
I rods spectrum (x3,y3,I0,498,0.58e-7,0.25*I_0,400,0.58e-7)
S cone spectrum (x4,y4,I0,420,0.58e-7)
`
___The spectra of `figure.receptor` were generated using these coefficients
and they may be compared favorably with
published absorption spectra for human photoreceptors,
notably `reference.Dartnall`.

___While the stored form of a full photograph would be
expanded by about a factor of 4 with use of this representation,
an image composed of photons from point sources may actually be
far smaller than with traditional RGB digital images yet
capable of expressing the full spectra required for analyzing
vision in natural light settings.

=== Photon probability chain

Probabilities for photon capture are products of probabilities
for every step between emission and absorption.
The spectrum of blackbody emission \(E_{\lambda}\) is
a probability function of wavelength.
Objects have a surface reflectance spectrum \(S_{\lambda}\).
The cornea and lens have a refraction spectrum \(L_{\lambda}\)
at each retinal photoreceptor.
The pupil has a diffraction spectrum \(P_{\lambda}\)
at each retinal photoreceptor where it is absorbed.
Finally, each species of photoreceptor has
an absorption spectrum \(A_{\lambda}\).
The relative probability of a photon from the point source
being absorbed by the particular photoreceptor is shown in `equation.chain`.

`equation.chain|Probability chain|
E_{\lambda} * S_{\lambda} * L_{\lambda} * P_{\lambda} * A_{\lambda}
`

`graph.chain|Probability chain|
"Photon\nEmission"->
"Surface\nReflection"->
"Lens\nRefraction"->
"Pupil\nDiffractive"->
"Photoreceptor\nAbsorption";
`


In effect, each spectrum between emission and absorption
modifies the image as absorbed.
No single step in the chain stands alone as dominating the result.
Isotropic emission from a blackbody doesn't alter
the course of a photon to the photoreceptor.
Isotropic reflection, also, doesn't differentially change photon pathways.
Refraction performs an Affine transform with the pattern seen for
short wavelength photons displaced further to the outside.
Diffraction performs two function:
convolution with a spatially limited discrete Airy kernel
followed by an affine transform with
long wavelength photons displaced further to the outside.

The resulting function of wavelength forms a probability pattern
which may be converted to a wave equation for superposition.
Since the final step in the chain is multiplication by
the absorption spectrum of the photoreceptor,
the apparent image incident on each species of receptor
differs substantially from that for other species.
